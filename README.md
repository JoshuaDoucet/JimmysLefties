## Jimmy's Lefties
A website for helping people with one foot find one show.
The site scrapes data from other online sites that sell one-off shoes, and puts them all in one list for users to search through. Users can sort by shoe size, color, and gender. The site will also display a bart of the shoes that appear by size.
